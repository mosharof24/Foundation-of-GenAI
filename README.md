# Deep Generative Models — Theory to Practice

A **math-first, implementation-oriented** collection of Python notebooks and reference code for **Deep Generative Models (DGMs)**.  
This repository bridges **probabilistic foundations**, **optimization theory**, and **modern architectures** powering today’s image generators and Large Language Models (LLMs).

> _Learning generative models is like learning to cook without a recipe — divergences are taste tests, GANs are chef vs critic, diffusion sculpts order from noise, and alignment tunes the dish to human preference._
